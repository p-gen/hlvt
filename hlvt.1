.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBhlvt [\-l screen_lines] [\-f] [\-n]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This program is a minimalist and incomplete headless terminal emulation.
.sp
Its aim is to be able to process a typescript like the one generated by
codes like \fIptylie\fP or the well known \fIscript\fP utility and render it in
a virtual screen.
.sp
The resulting output is the screen after all the typescript content has
been interpreted.
.sp
If the \-n option is not present, then each screen line will be followed
by an attributes line which can be empty if no attribute has been set
in this line.
.sp
This program uses \fIVTParse\fP (\fI\%https://github.com/haberman/vtparse\fP) by Joshua
Haberman kindly put in the public domain, enhanced to support UTF\-8. in
fact the supported encodings and only UTF\-8 and ASCII 7\-bit.
.sp
This program take its input from the standard input write to the standard
output.

.TP
.B WARNING
Only the latest (screen_lines) lines displayed on the virtual screen
will be shown, the scrolled up ones will be lost.
.TP
.B IMPORTANT
For now and until I find a solution, is is capital to interpret a
typescript made immediately after having clearing the screen because
some escape sequences such as CUP address the cursor with absolute
coordinates.
.sp
If these numbers are below the bottom of the virtual screen, this
will result in garbage when running this program. So remember to
use the clear command before recording some terminal activities.
.TP
.B NOTE
The understood terminal sequences are those parsed by \fIVTParse\fP,
see \fI\%http://vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser.html\fP for more details.
