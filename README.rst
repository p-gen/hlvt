Description
===========
This program is a minimalist and incomplete headless terminal emulation.

Its aim is to be able to process a typescript like the one generated by
codes like *ptylie* or the well known *script* utility and render it in
a virtual screen.

T he resulting output is the screen after all the typescript content has
been interpreted.

This program uses *VTParse* (https://github.com/haberman/vtparse) by Joshua
Haberman kindly put in the public domain, enhanced to support UTF-8. in
fact the supported encodings and only UTF-8 and ASCII 7-bit.

This program take its input from the standard input write to the standard
output.

Synopsis
========
``hlvt [-l screen_lines] [-f]``

-l  describes the number of lines of the virtual screen, the number of
    columns is not limited.  By default, the virtual screen has 24 lines.
-f  adds some formatting to the outputs and is not needed in most cases.

WARNING
    Only the latest (screen_lines) lines displayed on the virtual screen
    will be shown, the scrolled up ones will be lost.

IMPORTANT
    For now and until I find a solution, is is capital to build the
    typescript after having clearing the screen. Some escape sequences
    such as CUP address the cursor with absolute coordinates.

    If these numbers are below the bottom of the virtual screen, this
    will result in garbage when running this program. So remember to
    user the clear command before recording some terminal activities.

NOTE
    The understood terminal sequences are those parsed by *VTParse*,
    see http://vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser.html for more details.

How to build
============
The content of the archive is complete and a single configure/make/make install should be enough.

Notice that the files VTParse_table.[ch] are generated from the ruby files, hence ruby is required
if your remove these files or modify the file VTParse_tables.rb

Have fun.
